Data and code for analysis and figures

-Before running the script corresponding to the analysis and panels behind each of the figures in the manuscript, please make sure to unzip all files and subfolders within the /Data folder and all s

To run the script for any of these:

1. Open folder for the figure and the underlying analysis to be reproduced.

2. unzip all files and subfolders within the /Data folder. These were compressed to facilitate the upload into GitHub.

3. Select the project corresponding to each figure (i.e., Figure 1.Rproj). A new R session (process) should start.

4. From the opened project in RStudio, Open the .R script for that figure (i.e., Figure 1.R).

5. Running the opened script should run sourcing the data files from the /data folder.

- The raw outputs from GWA analysis are placed in the corresponding figures in the data/GWAS subfolder.
- Filtered and annotated versions of those raw GWASP outputs will be produced in the /tables folder.
- Similarly, the output of TWAS analysis will be saved in the same/tables folder.

For any questions regarding any of these analyses and code, please email Ángel Ferrero-Serrano (aaf11@psu.edu)


***Upload in progress (5/10/21). This should be completed within the next few days.
