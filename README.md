#### Data and code for analysis and figures

- Before running the script corresponding to the analysis and panels behind each of the figures in the manuscript, please make sure to unzip all files within the /Data folder and its subfolders.

##### To run the script for any of these:

- Open folder for the figure and the underlying analysis to be reproduced (i.e., Figure 1).

- Unzip all files and subfolders within the /Data folder. These were compressed to facilitate the upload into GitHub.

- Select the project corresponding to each figure (i.e., Figure 1.Rproj). A new R session (process) should start.

- From the opened project in RStudio, Open the .R script for that figure (i.e., Figure 1.R).

- Running the opened script should run sourcing the data files from the /data folder.

- Figure should render the figures in the main figure folder.

- The raw outputs from GWA analysis are placed in the corresponding figures in the data/GWAS subfolder.

- Filtered and annotated versions of those raw GWAS outputs will be produced in the /tables folder.

- Similarly, the output of TWAS analysis will be saved in the same/tables folder.

##### *For any questions regarding any of these analyses and code, please email Ángel Ferrero-Serrano (aaf11@psu.edu)*

***Upload in progress (5/10/21). This should be completed within the next few days.
